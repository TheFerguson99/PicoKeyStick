This is a Circuitpython programm for the Raspberry Pie Picko.
i used the vcc_gnd_yd_rp2040.
but should work for any board, just declare your neopixel pin if you have one/want to use it.

When first running the programm since init is false default wise, it will enable DEBUG and show_usb.

The board can also auto execute a ducky-script when connected to a pc.
For this DuckyMode and auto_payload have to be True.
Then once the file /payload/duckyscript.txt got executed,
auto_payload then gets set False

[Generel]
This project is to have a device that enters your passwords for you.
It help you have long and strong passwords that you normally wouldnt be able to remember.
This is not super secure, only usefull for everyday normal jon does.
I am no expert but I belive that it is possible to readout what is on the flash and therfore find out all passwords that are saved.
But if you are like me someone who wants to have strong passwords but dosnt have anything of interest that people with good enougth 
computer skills want, then this is for you.

Curently i have it on my key chain with another usb drive that has Simple Serial on it to comunicate with the pico over serial.
(Maybe find better way to talk to microcontroller from pc)

I am no professional in these fields, use of any kind is at your own risk.

This is a Project of mine, i dont know how the future will look.

I want it to be opensource and comunity driven but i havent had anything in that direction.

TODO:

Second serial port: It seems to be posible to have a second serial port without REPL but i havend had luck in getting it to work.
Encryption: I want all csv files to be encrypted. Have to think about how to implement it best, security wise.
CSV Updating: Wen updating a csv i belive it has trouble with the formating. This should be fixed first!!!
